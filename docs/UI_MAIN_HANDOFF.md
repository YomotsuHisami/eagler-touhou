# Current-main frontend migration handoff

Updated 2026-10-04. Continue on `experiment/ui-main`; do not merge or deploy as
part of this handoff. Preserve reusable TS business/protocol/storage code while
retiring obsolete UI only after its capabilities and publication paths migrate.

## Verified published checkpoints

- `83fe4c066d2f135e26b10d3d3c388bcd98d9108e`: earlier bounded sample; 208 synthetic
  browser tests passed. This does not establish original-game or phone acceptance.
- `b7ad9e3ee42c12921e8681279b6ded882e1193f2`: resources, Replay, measured touch editor,
  shared dirty-draft/Runtime guard, general published TH06–TH11 preparation and
  explicit Start. Exact snapshot: 210 Node checks and type/build checks passed.
  Browser CI: 231/236; four failures were an invalid background-toolbar visibility
  lookup while a modal was open; one WebKit motion test missed its arbitrary
  opacity window during a 650ms sampling gap.
- `665b563494395d769b4c21b65ff828c5f46e0ae2`: scoped tests repair. It checks the actual
  prepared state while the modal is open and accepts genuinely running interior
  animation frames. Real duration, continuity and DOM-identity assertions remain.
  Exact snapshot: 213 Node checks, SPA and fixture builds passed. Recheck this
  revision's browser CI: 234/236 passed. The remaining two failures were old-document metadata fetches during reload. A shared document fetch gate and 11 deterministic lifecycle cases now address that source race; actual WebKit confirmation awaits the next CI.

Main's reviewed content baseline remains `a1426aba791a1eb2e1d52b2e9bf489d7af91761e`.
`experiment/ui-rebuild` is an untouched historical backup, not the new entry.

## Integrated source verification awaiting its next commit CI

The frozen integrated source passes 413 Node checks (18 route/deployment and 395
UI service/contract cases), both TypeScript projects, ownership checks, the SPA
build and the synthetic harness build. There are 264 browser cases across six
files awaiting the new commit CI. These counts are not real-game or phone passes.

## Current ownership

- Framework SPA Router owns location and history. `/play/:productId` is the UI
  namespace; `/games/**` remains game resources. The root RuntimeControls blocker
  coordinates registered unsaved drafts before Runtime exit consent.
- RuntimeService alone owns the retained iframe, native file protocol, epochs and
  Package/code leases. Exclusive prepared file sessions prevent Start/cancel from
  racing Replay or save transactions. No React view writes IDBFS independently.
- Preferences and resource/launch/file controllers are plain TS services. Views
  emit intents. Providers retain jobs across route changes and fence document loss.
- Package installer owns serialization, Web Locks, staging and atomic generation
  commits. Resource removal must detach a confirmed current pointer and preserve
  retained generations/objects; it is not a save-data deletion or forced GC.
- New build ownership proof lists source modules, chunk bytes and lazy imports.
  Legacy app/lobby DOM bootstraps and Node-only modules may not enter the new graph.

## Continuing work, not yet an overall completion claim

The next integrated implementation includes local ZIP/raw-DATA import, confirmed
base-resource detach, root provider/view splitting, legacy links, directory and room
state with authoritative Runtime handoff, MIDI, progressive OGG, language cache and
fallback, live touch/viewport/magnifier, locale/notices/help, and save replacement
with fresh-owner byte reread. Check the exact commit and CI before accepting any
browser result. Injected transport/storage tests are not live relay or durable
browser/gameplay evidence.

Remaining parity and retirement gates:

1. Complete room membership, calibration, Adonis/session/Runtime handoff, spectator
   and Replay-viewer flows through existing authoritative contracts. A directory
   create/join URL is not proof that a room or game started.
2. Complete progressive OGG, language cache/fallback, MIDI foreground handling,
   live input/viewport/magnifier and player tools without duplicate owners.
3. Finish locale, notices/help and remaining settings/management behavior.
4. Migrate Host/self-host/external/offline/PWA build and update contracts. The
   current production publication chain still uses legacy entry artifacts.
   Do not delete their sources before replacing their actual consumers.
5. Remove obsolete UI/bootstrap/CSS/history special cases and update tests/docs.
   Keep source contracts, Package/Runtime services and supported capabilities.
6. Original-game flow, durable browser storage, actual target phone and browser
   versions remain unverified. Continue independent source work; do not bypass
   browser access restrictions or represent synthetic tests as device evidence.

## Reproduction

Use Node 24 and the locked dependencies:

```sh
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm run check:ui
node scripts/build-ui-harness.mjs
```

Only in a permitted browser environment:

```sh
npm run test:ui:browser
```

See [local acceptance](UI_MAIN_LOCAL_ACCEPTANCE.md) for external private asset
mounting. Public TH06 metadata and six matching runtime/DATA/font files from
`https://touhou.vip/` were retrieved and verified: 25,117,488 payload bytes, current
Runtime generation `67be4524066a23a17bd6fb084abf58899462447248331fb9081e66b27c0a7110`,
Package revision `0fdb4ee3acc78b2a`. Game bytes stay outside Git and the UI output.
Their hash/layout and HTTP mount checks passed; execution did not occur.

No PR, comments, merge, deployment, private data upload or production SW changes
are implied by this branch work. Unrelated reported security issues remain outside
this migration's approved changes.
